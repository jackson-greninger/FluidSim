# Fluid Sim!

In my unending search to find a passion within computer science, I present to you my fluid simulation. 

This project was heavily inspired by Sebastian Lague's coding adventure video, where he does a phenomenal job of explaining the specifics of Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics and how to implement it into a Unity script. I'll leave his video below if you want to check it out.
